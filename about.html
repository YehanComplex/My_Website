<h2>My Situation</h2>
<p>
I have had a strong interest in mathematics and science since childhood, and I began studying calculus at the age of 14.
After turning 18, my path became somewhat non-linear: I took various courses, worked different jobs, and eventually earned a Bachelor’s degree in Physics at the age of 32.
During my studies, my main goal was not to achieve the highest grades possible, but to find a field I genuinely wanted to pursue afterward. I earned good grades and reached the level where I could qualify for a master’s program, but after identifying the direction I truly care about, I realized that physics may be better suited for me as a serious hobby rather than as a formal academic career. The work I want to do does not fit easily within the institutionalized system, and my specific interests are not widely supported there.
I have therefore decided to pursue a master’s degree in a field related to econometrics. I have a genuine interest in this area, especially in topics such as economic crises, money, and inflation — subjects that are likely to become even more important in the future. I am also considering a master’s program in Complex Systems, which aligns well with the kind of interdisciplinary work I enjoy.
Based on the work I have done so far, I believe it is reasonable to expect that I will have the opportunity to move forward in one of these directions.

<p>
I became interested in the origin of life and the complexity of biological systems during the last year of my bachelor’s degree. I had originally 
wanted to pursue particle physics, but after performing poorly in my final quantum mechanics course, I became frustrated and gradually lost interest,
 finding biological complexity and life far more engaging.
My professor for biophysics, Anton Zilman, was available to guide me, and during that time I began working on my monograph <i>On the Phenomenon of Life</i>,
collecting research and developing my ideas. Unfortunately, he passed away before I could complete it.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, I also conducted my own research in economics, which I called <i>Economic Machinery</i>, exploring how economic systems function from psychology
to dynamics.

<h2>Education</h2>

<p> Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Physics- University of Toronto </p>

<h2>Research Experience</h2>

<p>
I conducted independent research into the computational aspects of life and composed a monograph, <i>On the Phenomenon of Life</i>. The significance of
this work lies in that it introduces a rigorous framework through which aspects of life and consciousness can be approached in a more 
straightforward way. Essentially, it translates long-standing philosophical questions into a formal, mathematical framework.
I had planned to present my work to Professor Anton Zilman of the University of Toronto, but unfortunately, he passed away before I could complete it.
Professor Anton Zilman was an outstanding professor and researcher, a tremendous asset to the University of Toronto. He would have been the first person to
listen to my work, as he likely would not have had the time to read my full monograph.
</p>

<p>
I also had a strong ambition to understand the machinery of economics. I conducted my own research, exploring everything from psychology to dynamics, and
composed another monograph titled <i>Economic Machinery</i>.
</p>


<h2>Why I did independent research?</h2>

<p>
During the COVID-19 pandemic (2019–2022), I was completing my bachelor’s degree in Physics at the University of Toronto. During this period, my interests
shifted from my original focus. I had initially wanted to study particle physics, but after performing poorly in the fourth-year quantum mechanics course,
I became frustrated and decided to explore other areas.
</p>

<p>
I then developed an interest in complex systems and nonlinear dynamics. During this time, I also became deeply interested in the study of life. 
There was no established theory of life introduced in physics, and it struck me as remarkable how such complex processes occur inside cells, 
so different from simpler systems like gases with particle collisions.
I felt that I could make a meaningful contribution to the field and experienced a strong, persistent urge to pursue it.
</p>

<p>
During the COVID‑19 crisis, I also experienced a period of serious reflection. I worried about my own mortality and began to think more deeply
about what I wanted to contribute in the time I had. It occurred to me that working on questions such as the origin of life and biological complexity 
independently felt more meaningful to me than continuing along a long institutional path in particle physics without knowing whether 
I would ever have the chance to make a real impact. 
</p>

<p>
I have achieved what I set out to do: I have composed a monograph and developed a coherent explanation of what life is.
My monograph is, in fact, likely to be as significant as Schrödinger’s <i>What Is Life?</i>. I believe that Schrödinger himself would have appreciated it.
</p>

<p>
As I became concerned about the development of economic chaos, I also developed an interest in economics. Separately, I carried out another project and 
composed a second monograph on the subject, which I titled <i>Economic Machinery</i>.
</p>

<p>
I am an autistic individual, and based on what I have read, I am thought to have an interest-driven nervous system. 
This partly explains why I have behaved in a certain manner.

<h3>Positive outcomes</h3>
<section id="positive-outcomes">
    <ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
    <li>
	<p>
      It was important that I followed what truly mattered to me, because I might otherwise have become seriously ill and faced the 
	  end of life without having accomplished anything meaningful (In the present times, many people do get sick at younger age).
	  Many opportunities that once existed are no longer available today — what was once legal, free, or affordable is often no longer so.
	  I was able to complete my work before it became impossible to do so.
	  </p>
    </li>
    <li>
		<p>
      The conventional path of moving directly into a master’s program and working under a professor on a topic not of my choosing would
     not have been effective for me. I felt a strong inner drive to pursue my own direction, and suppressing that urge would have been
	 deeply difficult.
	  </p>
    </li>
    <li>
		<p>
      Now that I have achieved what I set out to do, I find that I am better able to focus on responsibilities and expectations set by others,
	  rather than being compelled to pursue only my own projects.
	   </p>
    </li>
	
	<li><p> If my work is recognized, it could lead to better employment or research opportunities.

<h3>Negative outcomes</h3>


  <ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
    <li>
      <p>Difficulty gaining recognition, which is a barrier I must overcome.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>I am beginning to feel that having a partner, children, and family seems very distant to me.</p>
    </li>
   
	<li><p>I have negatively affected my financial standing and security.</p></li>
  </ul>


<h2>Some of my views on education</h2>
<p>
I believe that the education system should evaluate students based on their unique skills rather than standard, expected qualifications.
This could be achieved by allowing students to complete independent projects, and compete in more diverse competitions, for which they would be
willing to cover any additional associated costs.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, I think that professors engaged in research should not be required to teach courses repeatedly unless they choose to.
Instead, lectures could be recorded, and teaching assistants could handle grading under guidance and supervision from the professor.
