<h2> Vision  </h2>
		<p>
		 I am interested in a wide range of subjects, including life and biological complexity, classical and quantum 
		 computational theory, economics and econometrics, and social dynamics. I enjoy exploring these areas in depth,
		 while also keeping a broad awareness of fundamental physics—such as gravity and particle physics—to stay connected
		 with current scientific thinking.

         My goal is to build on the work initiated by pioneers like John von Neumann, Alan Turing, and Gregory Chaitin in
		 computational and complexity theory, and to collaborate with others in sharing new ideas with the world. Over my 
		 lifetime, I too aspire to contribute by publishing a series of books and research works.
		 Currently, my work has been conducted independently. I warmly welcome the opportunity to have it refined and edited 
		 so that it could potentially be published in professional journals such as arXiv.
		 </p>
		 
		 <p><b>At present, my goal is to enter the right master’s program or to secure employment in an environment that allows 
		 me to progress further.</b> I specifically plan to pursue a master’s program in a field such as econometrics, while 
		 continuing computational theory of life as a personal hobby.</p>

                        An independent study investigating the nature of life from the perspective of computational theory. 
						The work presents a generalized computational framework and applies it to explain processes such as
						self-replication, and consciousness. 
						I began this research during the Covid-19 pandemic, motivated by a fear of mortality and a desire to 
						understand, for myself, what life truly is.
						This study is self-contained, presenting both the main results from research on the origin of life
						and the computational theory necessary to understand them. While I am modest about the depth of 
						mathematics I was able to explore, I am particularly proud of applying the theories of Turing,
						von Neumann, and Chaitin to a domain largely overlooked by physicists—an area they often assumed
						held little interesting mathematics or physics.

                        Economic systems can be challenging to understand due to their cyclic nature, 
                        complex interactions, and network effects. In this work, I investigate the machinery
                        of economics—beginning with human drives and progressing to more technical aspects. 
                        Time series data is analyzed to reveal underlying cycles, and the use of interest 
                        rates as a tool to steer the economy is explored. Additionally, topics such as the 
                        global cost-of-living crises and the future of an AI-driven economy are briefly 
                        discussed.
