<h2>Help!</h2>

<p>
Currently, I am seeking advice or opportunities to pursue my dream of building a scientific career, either formally, or informally. 
My plan is to study econometrics at the master’s level, while continuing to explore my favorite subject, the computational theory of 
life, as a personal hobby. I am also open to teaching at the high school level while conducting my research independently.
</p>

<p>
I also require assistance in preparing my monographs for peer review and publication in journals such as  <i>arXiv</i>.
